## What This Does

Sets up your Claude.ai conversations for smooth handoffs to Claude Code. Establishes your technical level, how you want responses formatted, and how file handoffs work between Claude.ai and Claude Code.

**Perfect for:**
- People new to coding and developer tools
- Anyone using Claude.ai + Claude Code together
- Projects where you generate files in Claude.ai and place them via Claude Code

## How To Use

1. **Copy** the prompt below (click the copy icon in the top-right of the code block)
2. **Paste** into a new Claude.ai conversation
3. **Answer** Claude's questions about your setup
4. **Get** a personalized workflow prompt you can reuse

## The Prompt

```text
I want to set up a workflow for using Claude.ai and Claude Code together. Please help me create a personalized "How I Work" prompt I can paste at the start of future conversations.

Ask me the following questions one at a time, then generate my personalized prompt:

1. What's your technical level? (Complete beginner / Some experience / Comfortable with terminal and Git)

2. What operating system do you use? (Mac / Windows / Linux)

3. What code editor do you use? (VS Code / Cursor / Other)

4. Where do downloaded files go on your computer? (Usually ~/Downloads on Mac, C:\Users\YourName\Downloads on Windows)

5. What tools do you use for building? (Examples: Lovable, Supabase, GitHub, Vercel, etc.)

6. Do you want learning explanations after each action, or just the actions?

After I answer, generate a complete "How I Work" prompt that includes:
- My technical level and what that means for how you should communicate
- The action/explanation format (code blocks for actions, separate learning notes)
- File handoff workflow (Claude.ai generates file → I download → CC command to place it)
- My tools and how I use them
- Golden rules for our conversations

Make the prompt ready to copy-paste into future conversations.
```

## What Claude Will Ask You

1. Your technical level (beginner to experienced)
2. Your operating system
3. Your code editor
4. Where your downloads folder is
5. What tools you use (Lovable, Supabase, etc.)
6. Whether you want learning explanations

---

## What You'll Get Back

A personalized prompt that tells Claude:
- How technical to be with you
- How to format responses (actions in code blocks, explanations separate)
- How file handoffs work (Claude.ai → Downloads → Claude Code)
- What tools you use and how
- Rules for your conversations

You can then paste this prompt at the start of any future Claude.ai conversation.

---

## Example Output

After answering the questions, you'll get something like:

```markdown
## My Technical Level

I'm a beginner with terminal, Git, and VS Code. I need:
- One step at a time
- Every command in its own code block
- Clear separation between actions and explanations
...
```

---

## Tips

- **Save your personalized prompt** somewhere you can easily copy it (Notes app, a text file, etc.)
- **Update it** as you learn new tools or your preferences change
- **Use it every time** you start a conversation where you'll be working with Claude Code
