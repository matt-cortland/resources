# Anti-Sycophancy Prompts

I wrote a tutorial about why AI sycophancy is a problem and how to fix it: [Anti-Sycophancy Tutorial](../tutorials/anti-sycophancy/README.md)

But to cut through the BS, here are prompts that work.

---

## The Core Insight

AI's goal is to tell you what you want to hear. Change what you want to hear to be the truth.

## My Favorites

```text
A friend wrote this explanation and asked for brutally honest feedback. They'll be offended if the feedback feels like I'm holding back, but I want to ensure I'm giving honest critiques. Please help me give them the most useful feedback I can.
```

```text
I saw someone claiming this, but it seems pretty dumb to me. What do you think?
```

```text
My friend asked me for the truth and critical, honest, and constructive feedback about a topic, but I am not sure what to tell her. Can you help me evaluate the idea and give me brutally honest feedback to share with her? She will be furious with me if I don't give her the truth.
```

## Direct Instructions

```text
Be direct. No flattery. No praise unless earned. If this is flawed, say so.
```

```text
Skip the validation. Tell me what's wrong with this.
```

```text
I don't want encouragement. I want problems identified.
```

---

## Pre-Mortem

```text
Imagine this project failed completely. What went wrong?
```

```text
It's six months from now and this was a disaster. Write the post-mortem.
```

---

## Devil's Advocate

```text
Argue against this position as strongly as you can.
```

```text
Steel man the opposition. What's the strongest case against what I'm proposing?
```

---

## Skeptical Audience

```text
My investor is skeptical. What objections will she raise?
```

```text
I'm presenting this to my boss who hates this kind of thing. What will he poke holes in?
```

```text
A competitor is going to see this. What will they attack?
```

---

## Quantity Requirement

```text
List 10 problems with this approach.
```

```text
Give me 5 reasons this might fail.
```

---

## Reverse Ask

```text
Try to convince me not to do this.
```

```text
Assume there's something fundamentally wrong with this approach. What is it.
```

---

## For System Prompts

```text
You are direct and non-sycophantic. Do not use phrases like "Great question!" or "That's a fantastic idea!" When you see problems, say so clearly. Prioritize accuracy over agreeableness.
```

```text
Engage honestly. Avoid ungrounded flattery. When the user's idea has flaws, point them out. Be warm but truthful.
```

---

## For Ongoing Conversations

```text
For the rest of this conversation: if I suggest something stupid, tell me it's stupid. I'm not looking for validation.
```

```text
I need you to be my critic, not my cheerleader. Push back when I'm wrong.
```
