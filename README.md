## A Note on How This Is Written

Full disclosure: the guides and prompts in this repo are AI-generated writing, not first-pass written by me. I use Claude to draft, refine, and structure most of what you see here. I provide the ideas, direction, and editing — Claude does the heavy lifting on prose. I prefer working this way and I'm transparent about it.
