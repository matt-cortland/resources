# Useful Prompts

A curated collection of reusable AI prompts for Claude Code, Claude.ai, and other tools.

These are battle-tested prompts I've developed while building real products with AI assistants. They solve specific friction points — like handing files between Claude.ai and Claude Code, or teaching an AI to communicate at the right technical level.

## Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [How I Work With Claude Code](prompts/how-i-work-with-claude-code.md) | Sets up any Claude.ai conversation for smooth handoffs to Claude Code. Establishes technical level, formatting rules, file handoff workflow, and a two-part action/explanation response pattern. |

## How To Use

1. Open the prompt file you want
2. Copy the entire contents
3. Paste it at the start of a new Claude.ai conversation (or Claude Code session)
4. Add any project-specific context after it

## Adapting For Your Setup

These prompts are designed as starting points. To make one your own:

1. Start with the base prompt
2. Add your repos, project IDs, and tools
3. Add a "Context Loading" section listing the docs you regularly feed to your AI assistant
4. Save it somewhere you can grab it quickly
