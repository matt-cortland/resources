# CLAUDE.md

This is Matt Cortland's public resources repo for shareable prompts, tutorials, and writing.

## What This Repo Is

The public-facing version of resources-staging. Content goes through staging first, then gets pushed here when ready.

## Structure

```
resources/
├── prompts/           # Copy-paste prompts by platform
│   └── claude/        # Claude-specific prompts
├── CLAUDE.md          # You are here
└── README.md
```

## Workflow

1. New content goes to `resources-staging` first
2. Review and refine in staging
3. Push to this repo when ready for public

## Style

- Prompts at the top, context below
- No emdashes
- Dry, direct tone
- Copy buttons on all code blocks

## Your Jobs

1. Keep prompts organized by platform
2. Ensure all code blocks are copy-pasteable
3. Cross-link related prompts and tutorials
4. Do not add content directly here without going through staging first
